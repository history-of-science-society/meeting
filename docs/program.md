The sessions listed below represent the program that would have occurred if the HSS were able to meet in New Orleans. However, the global pandemic has made an in-person meeting impossible. We are grateful to our program chairs, Christine von Oertzen and Soraya de Chadarevian, for constructing such a comprehensive, engaging, and provocative program. Currently, the HSS is investigating how to transform this program into a virtual meeting. Stay tuned for updates!
