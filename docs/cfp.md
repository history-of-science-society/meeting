<span class="subtitle">General Rules and Guidelines</span>

**Nonrecurrence Rule**<br>
Anyone presenting an individual paper, flashtalk, or on an organized session or roundtable (including commentators) cannot appear on the meeting program in any other capacity. This rule does not apply to moderators or organizers, who could, e.g., moderate one session and present in another.

**Registration Required**<br>
When registration opens, all meeting participants must register for the meeting and pay the registration fee. Failure to pay this fee will result in removal from the program.

**Word Limit**<br>
All abstracts must be 2,000 characters or fewer (about 250 words).

**Selection Guidelines**<br>
The Committee on Meetings and Programs (CoMP) has established a set of best practices and guidelines for proposal, which inform the program chairs in their evaluation of abstracts for the meeting.

**Format**<br>
The submission form only accepts plain text, which disallows italics and bold. All titles should conform to the Chicago Manual of Style's title guidelines. Use a [title capitalization tool](https://thecapitalizer.com) to ensure your title conforms to CMS rules.
