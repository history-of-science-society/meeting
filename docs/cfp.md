The History of Science Society (HSS) will hold its 2020 conference New Orleans, LA, USA. This will be a joint meeting with the [Society for the History of Technology (SHOT)](https://www.historyoftechnology.org/). The Society encourages submissions on all topics. Proposals (2,000-character maximum per abstract) must be submitted via the HSS online submission form. Unlike many academic societies, the HSS does not require that participants be members, but all participants must register for the meeting.

## Guidelines

**One Submission**<br>
Only one proposal per person is permitted.

**Nonrecurrence Rule**<br>
Anyone presenting an individual paper, flashtalk, or on an organized session or roundtable (including commentators) cannot appear on the meeting program in any other capacity. This rule does not apply to chairs or organizers, who could, e.g., chair one session and present in another.

**Registration Required**<br>
Anyone who appears on the program must register for the meeting. Failure to pay this fee will result in removal from the program.

**Word Limit**<br>
All abstracts must be 2,000 characters or fewer (about 250 words).

**Selection Guidelines**<br>
The *Committee on Meetings and Programs (CoMP)* has established a set of [best practices and guidelines](http://bit.ly/comp-guidelines) for proposal. Program chairs will look to these best practices and guidelines when accepting abstracts for the meeting.

**Format**<br>
The submission form only accepts plain text, which disallows italics and bold. All titles should conform to the Chicago Manual of Style's title guidelines. Use a [title capitalization tool](https://thecapitalizer.com) to ensure your title conforms to CMS rules.

**Double Sessions**<br>
Organizers who wish to have more than 4 presentations in their session can propose a double panel. Please be aware that we can only accept a limited number of double sessions.

## Diversity

**Why we collect demographic data**

Driven by our mission “to foster interest in the history of science,” the HSS collects demographic information to understand the composition of its submitting authors, members, and meeting attendees; to identify under-served and under-represented communities; to formulate strategies to increase representation across communities; and to communicate aggregate, anonymized demographic data to its members and the public.

We are cautious of the exploitation enabled by demographic data collection. Therefore, we are committed to collecting information in a manner that is voluntary, promotes self-description, and is purposeful. The information will be used by the program co-chairs to guide their construction of the program with the goal of achieving balance in demographic characteristics and maximizing representativeness among the society’s communities.

The structure of this questionnaire is still in a pilot phase. We welcome your feedback via our <g-link to="/contact-us/">contact form</g-link>.

*–Committee on Diversity and Inclusion*

Demographic questions ask about insitutional affiliation, employment status, country of residence, gender, race and/or ethnicity, and HSS presentation history.

## Find a Collaborator

To encourage and aid the creation of panels with strong thematic coherence that draw upon historians of science across institutions and ranks, the HSS has created a [collaboration form](https://hssonline.formstack.com/forms/collaboration) to submit proposals in need of panelists and a [spreadsheet to review](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17DK9wBx_V4UvyNB747hbSaAGkBct4h9Gjg0S5T9Jl0k/edit?usp=sharing) submitted proposals. Anyone with a panel, paper, or roundtable idea seeking like-minded presenters should post and consult the postings on [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17DK9wBx_V4UvyNB747hbSaAGkBct4h9Gjg0S5T9Jl0k/edit?usp=sharing) to round out a prospective session.

## Independent Scholar Award

Thanks to a generous gift by HSS Member Virginia Trimble, the Society will offer for the first time an award of $500 for the best abstract submitted by an independent scholar. Those scholars who are part of an organized session or who submit a contributed paper, and whose institutions do not consider these scholars to be working historians are eligible. If you meet this criteria and would like to be considered, please inform your organizer or select this option on the submission form.

## HSS/SHOT Joint Session

Session proposals addressing themes and issues with interest to both societies are particularly welcome and will be included in both HSS and SHOT programs as joint sessions. When submitting a proposal for a joint session, please make explicit in your session abstract why/how your session brings together approaches/themes/speakers of interest to both HSS and SHOT. Additionally, select the option for joint session inclusion on the abstract form. Finally, authors and organizers must submit their proposals to the HSS and SHOT.

**Roundtable**

To facilitate dialogue at its annual meeting, the History of Science Society requests proposals for roundtables. Roundtable participants may not present in another session. The typical roundtable will feature 5 presenters, including a commentator, who will each speak for 10 minutes or less, leaving ample time for exchanges with the audience. (Roundtables may include from 4 to 8 total speakers.)

**Flashtalks ⚡**

As part of a special Presidential Session, the HSS invites graduate student proposals for flashtalks. The president of HSS will evaluate abstracts and moderate the session. These flashtalks will be presentations of 5 minutes or less and a slide, followed by discussion. Proposals require only a title and a short abstract (2-3 sentences). Flashtalks speakers are not permitted to present on the program in any other fashion.
