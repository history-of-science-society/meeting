The History of Science Society (HSS) will hold its 2020 conference in one of the US’s more interesting cities: New Orleans. This will be a joint meeting with the Society for the History of Technology (SHOT). The Society encourages submissions on all topics. Proposals (2,000-character maximum per abstract) must be submitted via the HSS online submission form. Unlike many academic societies, the HSS does not require that participants be members, but all participants must register for the meeting.

## Guidelines

**One Submission**<br>
Only one proposal per person is permitted.

**Nonrecurrence Rule**<br>
Anyone presenting an individual paper, flashtalk, or on an organized session or roundtable (including commentators) cannot appear on the meeting program in any other capacity. This rule does not apply to chairs or organizers, who could, e.g., chair one session and present in another.

**Registration Required**<br>
Anyone who appears on the program must register for the meeting. Failure to pay this fee will result in removal from the program.

**Word Limit**<br>
All abstracts must be 2,000 characters or fewer (about 250 words).

**Selection Guidelines**<br>
The Committee on Meetings and Programs (CoMP) has established a set of best practices and guidelines for proposal. Program chairs will look to these best practices and guidelines when accepting abstracts for the meeting.

**Format**<br>
The submission form only accepts plain text, which disallows italics and bold. All titles should conform to the Chicago Manual of Style's title guidelines. Use a [title capitalization tool](https://thecapitalizer.com) to ensure your title conforms to CMS rules.

## Diversity

A diverse community is necessary for the HSS to fulfill its mission statement, &ldquo;to foster interest in the history of science,&rdquo; and to help scholars tell the stories of science. Therefore, the HSS collects demographic information for the following purposes: to understand the composition of its submitting authors, members, meeting attendees, and website visitors; to identify underserved and under-represented communities; to formulate strategies to increase representation from affected communities; and to communicate this data with its members and the public.

The HSS will give strong preference to sessions that reflect diversity in affiliation, employment status, gender, race/ethnicity, and presentation history.

Because of this committment to diversity, the HSS requires authors and organizers to provide the following demographic information for each person participating on the panel:

- Name
- Email
- Affiliation (e.g., university, institution, company, independent scholar, etc.)
- Gender
- Race and/or Ethnicity
- Presentation history

## Independent Scholar Award

Thanks to a generous gift by HSS Member Virginia Trimble, the Society will offer for the first time an award of $500 for the best abstract submitted by an independent scholar. Those scholars who are part of an organized session or who submit a contributed paper, and whose institutions do not consider these scholars to be working historians are eligible. If you meet this criteria and would like to be considered, please inform your organizer or select this option on the submission form.

## HSS/SHOT Joint Session

Session proposals addressing themes and issues with interest to both societies are particularly welcome and will be included in both programs as joint HSS and SHOT sessions. When submitting a proposal for a joint session, please make explicit in your session abstract why/how your session brings together approaches/themes/speakers of interest to both HSS and SHOT.
