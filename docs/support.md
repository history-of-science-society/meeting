## Exhibit

**Book Exhibit**

The History of Science Society's book exhibit is the epicenter of the annual meeting. Attendees gather at the exhibit to meet with colleagues, peruse the latest titles in the field, to chat with potential publishers, or take a break from sessions.

- Over 88% of our 700 attendees actively visit the book exhibit, and over 35% of them will purchase at least one book.
- Scholars from around the world will use this opportunity to meet with editors - and to browse your display.
- Historians of science read widely in many disciplines and have diverse interests.
- The meeting will offer numerous opportunities to speak with potential authors and meeting attendees.
- Mid-morning and mid-afternoon coffee breaks will be set up in the exhibit area to encourage browsing.
