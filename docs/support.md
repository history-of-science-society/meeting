## Exhibit

**HSS/SHOT Book Exhibit**

The History of Science Society’s book exhibit is the epicenter of the annual meeting. It’ll be even bigger in 2020 because HSS is meeting with the [Society for the History of Technology](https://www.historyoftechnology.org/). That means more attendees visiting the exhibit, more scholars perusing the latest titles in the field, and more authors meeting with publishers. _Don’t miss the opportunity to engage these historians of science and tech!_

- Over 88% of our projected 1200+ attendees will actively visit the book exhibit, and over 35% of them will purchase at least one book
- Scholars from around the world will use this opportunity to meet with editors - and to browse your display
- Historians of science and technology read widely in many disciplines and have diverse interests
- Books discovered at the exhibit become required reading on future syllabi
- The meeting offers numerous opportunities to find your next authors
